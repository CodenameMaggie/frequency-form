# $10,000 in 15 Days - F&F Marketplace Arbitrage Model
**Strategy:** Act as middleman between buyers and manufacturers
**Model:** Pre-paid purchase orders → Source from suppliers → Keep 20-30% margin

---

## The Arbitrage Model

### How It Works:
1. **Get Purchase Orders** - Boutiques/customers order from F&F
2. **Collect Payment** - 50-100% upfront (pre-paid)
3. **Source Products** - Use customer's money to pay manufacturer
4. **Keep Margin** - 20-30% markup on all transactions
5. **Direct Fulfillment** - Supplier ships directly to customer (drop-ship)

### Why This Works:
✅ **Zero inventory risk** - Only order what's already sold
✅ **Cash flow positive** - Customer pays before you pay supplier
✅ **Scalable** - Can do 100 orders as easily as 10
✅ **Low overhead** - You're just the connector
✅ **Already have suppliers** - Henry found seamstresses and European brands
