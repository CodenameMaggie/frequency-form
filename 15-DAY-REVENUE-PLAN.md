## Common Objections & Responses

**"I need to think about it"**
→ "I understand! I have just 2 consultation slots left this week. Can I hold one for you until tomorrow?"

**"That's expensive"**
→ "Compared to fast fashion, yes. But you're getting a custom piece that will last 10+ years. That's actually $15/year."

**"I don't know if it will fit"**
→ "That's exactly why we start with measurements and a consultation. We'll ensure the perfect fit before production."

**"Can I see more examples?"**
→ "Absolutely! Here's my Instagram with more photos. Which style speaks to you most?"

**The Math:**
- 1 viral post → 1000 views → 50 clicks → 5 consultations → $375
- 1 boutique order → $200
- 3 pre-orders → $255
- 4 patterns → $100
- **Total: $930** (Close to $1000!)
