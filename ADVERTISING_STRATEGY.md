## 10. Competitive Differentiation

### How to Stand Out in Crowded Sustainable Fashion Market

**Don't compete on:**
- Lowest price
- Fastest shipping
- Widest selection

**Do compete on:**
- **Unique science angle** - No one else talks about fabric frequency
- **Curation quality** - Smaller, more intentional selection
- **Educational value** - Become the authority on fabric and energy
- **Premium positioning** - Luxury natural fibers, not "eco basics"

**Competitive Set:**
- Eileen Fisher (sustainable, but not frequency-focused)
- Patagonia (outdoor, not fashion-forward)
- Reformation (sustainable but includes synthetics)
- Everlane (transparency, but uses polyester)

**Our Edge:** We're the ONLY brand curating by fabric frequency with scientific backing.
