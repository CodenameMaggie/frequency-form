# 🚀 FREQUENCY & FORM - B2B WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION MODEL

## MAJOR PIVOT COMPLETE! ✅

Your business model has been **completely transformed** from B2C marketplace to **B2B wholesale distribution**. This is a MUCH more profitable and scalable model!

---

## 💰 THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL

### **OLD MODEL (Marketplace):**
Find brands → Invite to marketplace → They sell → You take 15-20% commission

### **NEW MODEL (B2B Distribution):**
Find retailers → Ask what they need → Source products → Sell wholesale → 40-50% markup

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS GENIUS

### **1. Higher Margins**

You sell wholesale: $70
Retailer sells: $120
YOU EARN: $30 (75% markup!)
```

### **2. Larger Order Volumes**

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Finding Manufacturers:**

**Alibaba.com:**
- Search: "organic cotton t-shirt manufacturer"
- Filter: Gold suppliers, Trade Assurance
- MOQ: Look for 100-500 unit minimums
- Request samples before bulk order

**Global Sources:**
- Higher quality than Alibaba
- Better for natural fibers
- More expensive but worth it

**Direct:**
- Email brands from your original marketplace plan
- Ask if they do wholesale/white label
- Many will say yes!

### **Pricing Formula:**

```
Manufacturer cost: $20
Your wholesale price: $35-40 (75-100% markup)
Retailer sells for: $70-80 (100% markup)
Win-win-win!
```

### **Negotiation Tips:**

**With Manufacturers:**
- Start small (100-500 units)
- Build relationship
- Get better pricing as volume increases
- Lock in annual contracts

**With Retailers:**
- Offer samples first
- Start with small test order
- Set up Net 30 payment terms (they pay 30 days after delivery)
- Offer early payment discount (2% off if paid in 10 days)

### **Closing Big Accounts (Winners, TJMaxx):**

1. **Research their vendor requirements:**
   - Visit their vendor portal
   - Understand their process
   - Prepare required documents

2. **Get a warm intro if possible:**
   - LinkedIn connections
   - Trade shows
   - Industry contacts

3. **Start with one product:**
   - Don't overwhelm with full catalog
   - Pick one hero SKU
   - Prove you can deliver

4. **Be patient:**
   - Can take 6-12 months to close
   - But one PO = $100K-1M
   - Worth the wait!

- Small accounts close faster
- Use them to refine your process

### **5. Don't Forget Follow-ups**
- Most deals close on 3rd-5th touch
- Set up CRM reminders
- Be persistent but not annoying
