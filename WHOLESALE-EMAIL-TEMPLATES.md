## Template 7: For Boutiques That Say "Too Expensive"

**Subject:** Re: Pricing Question - Let's Find What Works

Hi [First Name],

I completely understand the pricing concern. Let me share how other boutiques make this work:

**Option 1: Small Trial Order**
Start with just 3-5 pieces (your choice). Total investment: $300-500 wholesale.
Average boutique sells these in 2-3 weeks = $600-1000 retail = $300-500 profit.

**Option 2: Consignment**
We provide pieces on consignment. You only pay for what sells.
No risk, no upfront investment.

**Option 3: Custom Pricing for Launch Partners**
If you commit to being a regional partner, I can offer:
- Additional 10% discount on first order
- Exclusive territory rights
- Co-marketing support

The math: If you sell just 2 dresses per month ($180 retail), that's:
- $3,600/year retail revenue
- $1,800 profit at 50% markup
- Takes up less than 2 feet of rack space

Would any of these options work better for you?

Best,
Maggie

## Template 8: For Referral Requests

Hi [First Name],

Even though we're not the right fit for [Boutique Name] right now, I wanted to ask:

Do you know any other boutique owners or retail buyers who might be interested in a sustainable fashion line?

I'm looking to partner with 10-15 retailers this quarter, and I'd really appreciate any introductions you could make.

Happy to offer a referral bonus: $50 credit for any introduction that becomes a customer.

Thanks for considering!
