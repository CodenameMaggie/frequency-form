# Quick Start: Brand Outreach Strategy

## 🎯 YOUR UNIQUE POSITIONING

**Tagline:** *"The Curated Marketplace for Healing-Frequency Natural Fibers"*

### The 3 Things That Make You Different:

1. **Frequency Science** (NO ONE ELSE DOES THIS)
   - Only marketplace validating healing properties of fabrics
   - Each fabric type has documented frequency benefits
   - Educated audience who GETS it

2. **Founding Partner Scarcity**
   - First 50 brands: 15% commission FOREVER
   - After that: 20% commission
   - Featured placement + badge

3. **Radical Curation**
   - 100% natural fibers ONLY
   - No synthetics ever
   - No linen/wool blends (frequencies cancel)
   - Premium brands only

---

## 💪 WHY BRANDS SHOULD JOIN

### Pain Point You Solve:
*"Natural fiber brands are drowning in a sea of cheap synthetics on Etsy/Amazon. Their ideal customers can't find them."*

### Your Solution:
*"A curated marketplace where EVERY product is natural fiber. Your customers don't have to sift through polyester to find you."*

### The Economics That Work:
- **You:** 15-20% commission
- **Etsy:** 10% + 3% + $0.20 per listing
- **Amazon:** 15% referral fee + fulfillment fees
- **BUT:** You handle ALL marketing (they don't)

**Key selling point:** *"We bring the customers, you handle fulfillment, everyone wins."*

## 🔥 YOUR BEST HOOKS

### Hook #1: Scarcity
> "We're only accepting 50 Founding Partners. After that, commission goes from 15% to 20%. We're at 38 spots filled."

### Hook #2: Wrong Audience Problem
> "Your customers on Etsy are price-shopping. Our customers understand frequency science and will pay premium for natural fibers."

### Hook #3: Marketing Burden
> "You shouldn't have to be a marketing expert to sell great products. We handle SEO, email, and social."

### Hook #4: Fast Money
> "Weekly payouts vs monthly. Better cash flow for your business."
