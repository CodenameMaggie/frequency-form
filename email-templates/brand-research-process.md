## RESPONSE HANDLING

### When they reply interested:

**Send:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great to hear you're interested! Here's the application link:
[APPLICATION URL]

It takes about 5 minutes. Once you submit, our team reviews
within 24-48 hours.

If you have any questions before applying, let me know!

Best,
Henry
```

### When they have questions:

**Be ready to answer:**
- "What's the monthly fee?" → No monthly fee, just commission on sales
- "How many products can I list?" → Unlimited
- "Who handles shipping?" → You do (brand handles fulfillment)
- "What's your marketing strategy?" → SEO, email, social, partnerships with wellness brands
- "How do payouts work?" → Weekly via Stripe, $25 minimum
- "What if I want to leave?" → No contract, can leave anytime

### When they're on the fence:

**Scarcity angle:**
```
I totally understand - big decision. Just FYI, we're at 38 of 50
Founding Partner spots filled, so that 15% commission rate
will go away soon.

No pressure, but wanted you to have that context!
```
