Subject: Founding Partner invitation for [Brand Name]

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Brand Name] and was immediately drawn to your [specific product - linen sheets/wool blankets/etc]. The quality and commitment to natural fibers is exactly what we're looking for.

I'm reaching out because we're launching **Frequency & Form** - a curated marketplace for natural fiber brands - and I'd love [Brand Name] to be one of our **Founding Partners**.

**Why this matters:**

We're only accepting 50 Founding Partners, and they get:
- **15% commission (locked in forever)** vs our standard 20%
- Featured homepage placement with "Founding Partner" badge
- Access to customers who understand frequency science and natural fibers
- Weekly payouts, transparent reporting
- We handle marketing (SEO, social media, email campaigns)

**What makes us different:**

Unlike Etsy or Amazon, we ONLY accept natural fibers. No synthetics, ever. Our customers are wellness-conscious buyers who actively seek out healing-frequency textiles.

Think of it as a curated luxury marketplace meets frequency science.

**Next step:**

If you're interested in being one of the first 50, the application takes 5 minutes:
[APPLICATION LINK]

Or, if you'd prefer to chat first, I'm happy to jump on a quick call.

Looking forward to potentially partnering,

Henry

P.S. We're at 12 Founding Partners approved so far - spots are filling up.

## EMAIL 2: Follow-Up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Following up - [Brand Name] x Frequency & Form

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my email from Tuesday about our Founding Partner program.

I wanted to add a bit more context on why we're building this:

**The problem we're solving:**

Natural fiber brands like yours are competing with cheap synthetics on general marketplaces. Your customers have to sift through thousands of polyester products to find you.

**Our solution:**

A curated marketplace where EVERY product is:
- 100% natural fibers only
- Frequency-verified for healing properties
- Presented with beautiful, luxury-focused design

**The economics:**

- You keep 85% (Founding Partner rate)
- We handle customer acquisition
- Weekly payouts
- No listing fees

If this sounds aligned with your vision, I'd love to get [Brand Name] on board as one of the first 50.

Application: [LINK]

Best,
Henry

## EMAIL 3: Final Follow-Up (5 days later)

**Subject:** Last call - Founding Partner spots

Hi [First Name],

I'm checking in one last time about Founding Partner status for [Brand Name].

We're now at **43 of 50 spots** filled, and I genuinely think your brand would be a perfect fit for our wellness-conscious audience.

**Quick decision framework:**

✅ Apply if:
- You make products from linen, wool, organic cotton, hemp, silk, or cashmere
- You want access to customers who care about what touches their skin
- You're interested in 85% revenue share + weekly payouts

❌ Not a fit if:
- You use synthetic blends
- You're happy with your current marketplace performance
- You don't want to be curated

No pressure either way - just didn't want you to miss the window if you were interested.

Cheers,
Henry
